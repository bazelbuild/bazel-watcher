// Implements a platform-independent process group. In effect, this allows you
// to terminate an entire tree of processes in one go. On Linux, this uses the
// Process Group system. On Windows, this uses Job Objects.
//
// Most of the things you would normally do with an exec.Cmd are safe to do
// with the RootProcess() Cmd, with two exceptions:
//
// - You cannot call .Start() on it. Use ProcessGroup.Start() instead. Doing
//   so will work on Linux but not Windows.
// - You should not change .SysProcAttr.

// ProcessGroup represents a tree of processes that can be terminated
// simultaneously.
type ProcessGroup interface {
	RootProcess() *exec.Cmd
	Start() error
	Kill() error
	Wait() error
	Close() error
	CombinedOutput() ([]byte, error)
