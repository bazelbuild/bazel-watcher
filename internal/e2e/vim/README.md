# Vim tests

Vim has some interesting behavior in writing files to disk. These tests verify
that iBazel handles that correctly by simulating the exact actions of vim.

If you encounter additional edge cases in the way Vim (or any other editor)
writes files to disk, this is a great place to put them.
