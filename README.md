# Bazel watcher

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/7694a2e22dcb7ea2e2ec80bb7e8e0380c700079e761394096f.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/bazel/bazel-watcher-postsubmit)

Note: This is not an official Google product.

A source file watcher for [Bazel](https://Bazel.build) projects

Ever wanted to save a file and have your tests automatically run? How about
restart your webserver when one of the source files change? Look no further.

Install `ibazel` using one of the 3 methods [described below](#installation). Then:

```bash
# ibazel build //path/to/my:target
```

Hack hack hack. Save and your target will be rebuilt.

Right now this repo supports `build`, `test`, and `run`.

## Installation

There are several ways to install iBazel, documented below.

### Mac (Homebrew)

If you run a mac you can install it from [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```
$ brew tap bazelbuild/tap
$ brew install bazelbuild/tap/ibazel
```

### NPM

If you're a JS developer you can install it as a `devDependency` or by calling `npm install` directly in your project

```
npm install @bazel/ibazel
```

### Linux

Packages are available for the following distributions:

* **Arch Linux**: [`aur/ibazel`][install/linux/archlinux/aur]

[install/linux/archlinux/aur]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ibazel

### Compiling yourself

You can, of course, build iBazel using Bazel.

```
git clone git@github.com:bazelbuild/bazel-watcher
cd bazel-watcher
bazel build //ibazel
```

Now copy the generated binary onto your path:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bazel-bin/ibazel/$GOOS_$GOARCH_pure_stripped
```

where `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH` are your host OS (e.g., `darwin` or `linux`) and architecture (e.g., `amd64`).

## Running a target

By default, a target started with `ibazel run` will be terminated and restarted
whenever it's notified of source changes. Alternatively, if the build rule for
your target contains `ibazel_notify_changes` in its `tags` attribute, then the
command will stay alive and will receive a notification of the source changes on
stdin.

## Output Runner

iBazel is capable of producing and running commands from the output of Bazel commands. If iBazel is run with the flag `--run_output` then it will check for a `%WORKSPACE%/.bazel_fix_commands.json` and if present run any commands that match the provided regular expressions.
For example the commands defined by the following file will match `buildozer` commands found in the output and provide a prompt to run the command.
```
[{
    "regex": "^buildozer '(.*)'\\s+(.*)$",
    "command": "buildozer",
    "args":    ["$1", "$2"],
}]
```
Adding the flag `--run_output_interactive=false` will automatically run the command without prompting for confirmation.
The fields in `.bazel_fix_commands.json` are:

* regex: a regular expression that will be matched against every line of output.
    * backslash `\` characters will need to be escaped once for the regex to be parsed properly.
* command: a command that will be run from the workspace root.
* args: a list of arguments to provide to the command, with `$1` being the first match group of `regex`, `$2` being the second and so on.

## Profiling

iBazel has a `--profile_dev` flag which turns on a generated profile output file
about the build process and timing. To use it include this flag in the command line. For example,

```
iBazel --profile_dev=profile.json run devserver
```

The profile outfile is in concatenated JSON format. Events are outputted one per line.

}
```

## Remote events

Remote events require the client-side profiling script. If you are using the `ts_devserver` bazel rule, this script will automatically be included in the development bundle so you don't have to worry about including it. If you're not using `ts_devserver` for development mode, you can include the following script tag to pull in the client-side profiling script:

```
<script src="http://localhost:30000/profiler.js"></script>
```

The script is served by iBazel on port 30000 by default. If port 30000 is not available, iBazel will attempt to find another available port between 30001 and 30099.

Remote events in the profiler script are sent using the [Beacon API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API). This API is available in Chrome 39, Firefox 31, Edge and Opera 26. It is not available in Internet Explorer or Safari. Browser compatability can be checked [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon#Browser_compatibility).

If your browser does not support the Beacon API, you will see the following error in the console when including the profiler script: `iBazel profiler disabled because Beacon API is not available`.

## Custom remote events

When the profiler script is loaded, a `window.IBazelProfileEvent(eventType, data)` public API is made available for generating custom remote events. This function sends a custom REMOTE_EVENT to the iBazel profiler log.

| Param | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `eventType` | string | The event type that ends up in the 'remoteType' attribute of the REMOTE_EVENT. |
| `data` | any | Optional data associated with the event. This is converted to a string. If it is an object it will be converted to escaped JSON in the profiler log. |

## Additional notes

### Termination

SIGINT has to be sent twice to kill ibazel: once to kill the subprocess, and
the second time for ibazel itself. Also, ibazel will exit on its own when a
bazel query fails, but it will stay alive when a build, test, or run fails.
We use an exit code of 3 for a signal termination, and 4 for a query failure.
These codes are not an API and may change at any point.

### What about the `--watchfs` flag?

Bazel has a flag called `--watchfs` which, according to the bazel command-line
help does:

> If true, Bazel tries to use the operating system's file watch service for
> local changes instead of scanning every file for a change

Unfortunately, this option does not rebuild the project on save like the Bazel
watcher does, but instead queries the file system for a list of files that have
been invalidated since last build and will require reinspection by the Bazel
server.
