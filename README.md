# Bazel watcher

[![Build Status](https://ci.bazel.io/buildStatus/icon?job=Global%2Fbazel-watcher)](https://ci.bazel.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/Global%2Fbazel-watcher/activity/)

A source file watcher for [Bazel](https://Bazel.build) projects

Ever wanted to save a file and have your tests automatically run? How about
restart your webserver when one of the source files change? Look no further.

Compile the `//ibazel` target inside this repo and copy the source file onto
your `$PATH`.

Then:

```bash
# ibazel build //path/to/my:target
```

Hack hack hack. Save and your target will be rebuilt.

Right now this repo supports `build`, `test`, and `run`.

## Additional notes

### What about the `--watchfs` flag?

Bazel has a flag called `--watchfs` which, according to the bazel command-line
help does:

> If true, Bazel tries to use the operating system's file watch service for
> local changes instead of scanning every file for a change

Unfortunately, this option does not rebuild the project on save like the Bazel
watcher does, but instead queries the file system for a list of files that have
been invalidated since last build and will require reinspection by the Bazel
server.
